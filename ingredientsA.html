 <li><b>Butter.</b> I use salted butter, but unsalted butter would also be great. I just recommend tasting the dough to ensure that it's salted to your liking.</li>
<li><b>White Sugar.</b> You can use granulated white sugar or organic cane sugar.</li>
<li><b>Brown sugar.</b> I use light brown sugar in this recipe for the best results.</li>
<li><b>Flour.</b> I recommend using an unbleached, all-purpose flour to make these chocolate chip cookies.</li>
<li><b>Sea Salt.</b> I exclusively bake and cook with pure, fine sea salt.</li>
<li><b>Chocolate Chips.</b> As you can see from the photos, sometimes I use chocolate chunks, chopped chocolate, or chocolate chips.</li>
